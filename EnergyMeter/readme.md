This device allows you to measure the power consumption of your house. Sensor attaches to the power meter by the double sided adhesive tape and observes the indication LED by photoresistor. Signal from this device is afterwards processed by central unit and pulse count is uploaded to a server script using GSM module. This script calculates the current consumption rate as well as total daily power consumption using the known pulse count ratio per 1 kWh.
