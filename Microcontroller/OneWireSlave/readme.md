This is a program for microchip PIC 12F683 that emulates OneWire device on OW bus. Because of the strict timing requirements of one wire protocol, it is not possible to implement one wire slave fully on microcontroller running at 4MHz, luckily 12F863 allows switching the CPU clock to 8 MHz what is barely enough for the emulation. With some optimizations (replacing switches with IF clauses), precise delay loops and using precompiler macros this code is pretty stable. It is based on Bartek Fabiszewski (www.fabiszewski.net) code which was optimized to run on PIC16F84A running at 10MHz. Emulator supports these ROM codes: 0xF0 (search rom), 0x33 (send rom), 0xCC (skip rom) and function commands were designed to mimick the DS1820 thermometer. This is a proof of concept code wich requires some cleanup. Code can be built with HiTech PIC C 9.60.

Summary: One Wire slave emulator running on PIC12F683 without any external crystal.
